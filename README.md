# Cat-Image-Random
# Description
This is a simple Java GUI application that uses the Swing library to display a window with two buttons, "Randomized" and "Clear". The application sends a GET request to a public REST API that returns a random image of a cat. The image is then displayed in the main window of the application. The "Clear" button when clicked, it clears the image from the main window of the application.

# Requirements
Java 8 or later
Internet connection (to access the REST API)
How to use
